## Components :

### Controllers 🕹️
    |
    |-> Mediator between External Request/Client Layer and Service Layer
    |
    |-> Consists of API paths

### Services 👨‍🔧
    |
    |-> Mediator between Controllers and Repository layer
    |
    |-> Consists of Business Logic

### Repositories 🗃️
    |
    |-> Connects Services and Storage Layer to enhance Abstraction.
    |
    |-> Consists of Concrete Implementation.

### Interfaces 🧩
    |
    |-> Enforces Abstraction and Encapsulation with Loose Coupling between Components.

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) 🔁
    |
    |-> Abstraction and Behaviour Enforcing for Domains and its Methods.

### Middlewares 🌉
    |
    |-> Logs HTTP method with Color Grading based on Specific type of Request, path, and timestamp 

## Data Storage Layer :

### PSQL 
* Uses EFCore (ORM) for performing transactions with PSQL Database.

### Domains 🗂️
